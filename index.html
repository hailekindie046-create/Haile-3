    <h1>Coding</h1>
    <p>
        Coding is the process of writing instructions that computers can follow to perform specific tasks.<br>
        It involves using programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or HTML to build websites, apps, games,<br>
        and software systems. Coding teaches problem-solving, logical thinking, and creativity, making it a<br>
        valuable skill in many fields such as technology, science, business, and education. As the world becomes<br>
        more digital, learning to code opens up opportunities to innovate, automate tasks, and contribute to<br>
        shaping the future of technology.
